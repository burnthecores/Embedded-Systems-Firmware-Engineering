Introduction to Embedded Systems Engineering:

It is an Amalgamation of ECE, CS, EE & ME.

What Embedded system is?

It deals with a deeply embedded CPU(Central Processing Unit), which is what we find in most of Electronic devices we use.

ex: TV remote controller, Washing Machine, Wi-Fi Router, UPS( Uninterrupted Power Supply) etc. all have a CPU embedded in them, but we tend to not see that CPU
Modern Cars have 100s of CPU embedded in them performing many control tasks like Engine Control and many sensor activities to make the ride smoother.

The Electronics in which a CPU hidden in which, the user doesn't run his programs on is an Embedded system.(this is a blurred term)

There is a CPU involved, Why have a CPU? What is the CPU doing here?
If you want to make INDIVIDUAL Electronic circuits to take the system from one STATE to another(control tasks) it might not be practical.
What is a STATE?
ex: if you press on the accelerator the car changes its state (increases the speed) but to increase the speed the CAR has to increase the Fuel injection improves, Engine starts to fire a lot, RPM increases etc. this is called state management.


Why use CPU?
Because it is Programmable, it is flexible! (instead of Hardcore Electronic circuits designed to perform the State management which are not flexible)

Every STSTEM has its STATES completely defined, and the job of the CPU is to manage the STATES in conjunction with the SENSOR data.
ex: Temperature, pressure, light sensors etc.

Therefore the Embedded system does SENSE from the Environment, COMPUTE(CPU), ACTUATE.
